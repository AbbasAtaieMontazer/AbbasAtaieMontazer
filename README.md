# Hi, I'm Abbas Ataie 👋🏾 

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. My interest is in the React and Python ecosystem.
# Speaker Rider

Before I'll agree to a speaking event, I try to do as much research I can around the event to ensure it aligns with my ethos and only want to be involved with events that are inclusive of folks that have traditionally been underrepresented in technology.
